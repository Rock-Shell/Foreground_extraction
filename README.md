# Foreground_extraction
The aim of this project is to extract the foreground from an image. By doing this we can alter the background as per our wish and needs without disturbing the foreground.

See below example for reference

In first image the opencv symbol overlaps with the foreground( the dancing guy), unlike the second one.
